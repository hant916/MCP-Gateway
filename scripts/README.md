# Deployment Scripts

Automated deployment and management scripts for MCP Gateway.

## 📋 Available Scripts

### 1. `deploy.sh` - One-Click Deployment

Automates the full deployment process including build, test, Docker image creation, and Kubernetes deployment.

**Usage:**
```bash
./deploy.sh <environment> [options]
```

**Environments:**
- `staging` - Deploy to staging environment
- `production` - Deploy to production (requires confirmation)

**Options:**
- `--skip-build` - Skip Maven build
- `--skip-tests` - Skip running tests
- `--skip-migration` - Skip database migration
- `--dry-run` - Show what would be deployed without deploying
- `--force` - Skip confirmation prompts

**Examples:**
```bash
# Deploy to staging
./deploy.sh staging

# Deploy to production with all safety checks
./deploy.sh production

# Dry run to production
./deploy.sh production --dry-run

# Quick deploy (skip tests)
./deploy.sh staging --skip-tests
```

**Deployment Flow:**
1. ✅ Check prerequisites (kubectl, docker, maven)
2. ✅ Run tests
3. ✅ Build application (Maven)
4. ✅ Build Docker image
5. ✅ Push to Docker registry
6. ✅ Run database migrations
7. ✅ Deploy to Kubernetes

**Examples:**
```bash
# Rollback to previous version
./rollback.sh production

# Rollback to specific revision
./rollback.sh staging --revision 3

# Dry run
./rollback.sh production --dry-run
```

**Process:**
1. Show deployment history
2. Confirm rollback
3. Execute kubectl rollout undo
4. Wait for rollback to complete

./health-check.sh production
```

**Checks Performed:**
1. ✅ Kubernetes pod status
2. ✅ Actuator health endpoint
3. ✅ Readiness probe
4. ✅ Liveness probe
5. ✅ Database connectivity
6. ✅ Circuit breaker status
7. ✅ API endpoint responsiveness

**Output:**
```
[✓] All pods are ready (3/3)
[✓] Application health: UP
[✓] Application is ready

- Compressed backups (gzip)
- Automatic retention management
- Backup verification
- Optional S3 upload
- Size verification

**Backup Location:**
```
backups/
├── production/
│   ├── backup_production_20240115_120000.sql.gz
│   └── backup_production_20240116_120000.sql.gz
└── staging/
    └── backup_staging_20240115_120000.sql.gz
```

### 6. `restore.sh` - Database Restore

Restores database from backup file.

**Usage:**
```bash
./restore.sh <environment> <backup_file> [options]
```

**Options:**
- `--force` - Skip confirmation prompts

**Examples:**
```bash
# Restore staging database
./restore.sh staging backups/staging/backup_20240115_120000.sql.gz

# Force restore production (dangerous!)
./restore.sh production backups/production/backup_20240115_120000.sql.gz --force
```

**Safety Features:**
- Backup current database before restore
- Confirmation prompts (especially for production)
- Application shutdown during restore
- Verification after restore
- Automatic application restart

**Process:**
1. 🔍 Verify backup file integrity
2. 💾 Create backup of current database
3. 🛑 Stop application
4. 📥 Restore database
5. ✅ Verify restoration
6. ▶️ Start application

# Dry run first
./scripts/deploy.sh production --dry-run

# Actual deployment
./scripts/deploy.sh production

# Monitor logs
kubectl logs -f deployment/mcp-gateway -n mcp-gateway-production
```

#### Emergency Rollback

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Deployment Fails

**Check prerequisites:**
```bash
kubectl cluster-info
docker info
mvn --version
```

**View deployment logs:**
```bash
kubectl describe deployment mcp-gateway -n mcp-gateway-production
kubectl logs deployment/mcp-gateway -n mcp-gateway-production
```

### Health Check Fails

**Manual health check:**
```bash
# Port-forward to pod
kubectl port-forward -n mcp-gateway-production svc/mcp-gateway 8080:8080

# Check health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health | jq
```

### Database Migration Fails

**Check migration status:**
```bash
# Connect to database
psql -h $DB_HOST -U $DB_USER -d mcpgateway

# View migration history
SELECT * FROM flyway_schema_history ORDER BY installed_on DESC;
```

**Repair and retry:**
```bash
./scripts/migrate-db.sh production --repair
./scripts/migrate-db.sh production
```

### Rollback Issues

**Force rollback:**
```bash
# Manual rollback
kubectl rollout undo deployment/mcp-gateway -n mcp-gateway-production

# To specific revision
kubectl rollout undo deployment/mcp-gateway --to-revision=2 -n mcp-gateway-production
```

- [ ] Maintenance window scheduled (if needed)
- [ ] Rollback plan ready
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured

### After Deployment

- [ ] Test critical user flows
- [ ] Monitor for 15-30 minutes
- [ ] Update deployment documentation

---

## 🔐 Security Notes

1. **Never commit `.env` files** - Use `.env.example` as template
2. **Rotate credentials regularly** - Database passwords, JWT secrets
3. **Use separate credentials** for each environment
4. **Enable RBAC** in Kubernetes
5. **Restrict backup access** - Backups contain sensitive data
6. **Use secrets management** - Consider HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager
